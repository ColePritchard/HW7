This project was to scan myself and at least one other person, and then clean them up, combine them somehow, and print the result. Scanning with Skanect was fairly easy and straightforward, the problems came when the 5000 poly limit was imposed, removing a lot of the detail of the scans. Even more problems arose when I took the models into 3dsMax to clean them up, I found that Skanect imagined that the objects being scanned were basically hollow. This led to a lot of tedious cleanup and some unusable scans due just to the vast amount of floating polys and holes. I eventually got some clean sections of karens arms, and managed to clean up my torso scan. I then used meshmixer to combine them and do some sculpting to blend them together. It’s a lot easier to do this in Meshmixer than Max, even though it has a bunch of limitations and problems. I chopped off my arms, added a bunch of tiny Karen arms, added goggles, and added an eyeball coming out of my chest. I’m fairly happy with the result, tiny as it is. The eye doesn’t really look too much like an eye, but it’s no big deal. The arms are the main feature of the print.
